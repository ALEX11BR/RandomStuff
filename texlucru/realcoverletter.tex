Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a third-year student at Politehnica University of Bucharest, and would like to apply for a Quant Development, Systems Infrastructure or Platform Engineering Intern position with Quadrature, as advertised on your website.

Software engineering appeals to me because it brings the ability to make complex but important things more accessible to the general public.

With a range of experiences in software development, from the many personal projects made using a variety of programming languages to contributions to various open source projects, like OpenTTD and Unikraft, I am confident that I can develop the necessary software solutions that meet the company's needs and be part of a growing team of passionate developers like me.

I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview.

Yours sincerely,

Ioan Alexandru Popa
